							<p class="p1 col1">Name: Nozer H Canteenwalla</br>
Age at interview : 48 years</br>
Sex : Male</br>
Background: For more than eight years, Nozer H Canteenwalla endured dialysis treatments three times a week, as he was suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). See how he was given a second chance at life after he received a cadaver organ transplant.</p>

							<p class="col1">When did you first realize that you were not well?</p>
							<p> was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disorder around June 2003. Actually, it is a hereditary disease from my mother’s side. I lost my grandmother to it and even my mother underwent dialysis for almost two years. As it was a hereditary problem, I underwent a test, which was positive. However, the kidneys were functioning properly and hence there was nothing to worry. But gradually, as I was unable to take proper care of my kidneys, the condition of the kidneys deteriorated when I was just 38. One day I came from office and realized that I had not used the bathroom the whole day. So I got my blood tests done and came to know that my kidneys had given up completely. As it was a family condition, I knew what to expect.</p>
							</br>
							
						
						<div class="clear"></div>
						<p class="col1">What was the initial prognosis by the doctor?</p>I had an infection in my kidneys and the doctor to whom I had gone first was not able to treat it. Due to this, the condition of the kidneys deteriorated even more. Actually, if the kidneys function normally, one could lead a healthy life for 30-40 years even if one has polycystic kidneys. But I had a severe infection due to eating out often. Also, the doctor could not control the infection and I was directly put on dialysis. I took a discharge from that hospital and consulted Dr. Bharat Shah of Narmada Kidney Foundation.

							<p class="col1"><a href="#">What was the treatment suggested to you by the doctor initially?</a></p>
							<p>Dr. Bharat Shah was able to bring down the creatinine level of the kidney and thus control it’s functioning through proper diet and just a few medicines. </p>
